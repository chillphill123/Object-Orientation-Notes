# object orientate programming notes 1

I think OPP is awesome!

```python 
# Example

OOP 1 SLIDESHOW NOTES

# Class: An abstract description of all objects that can be made from this set class where an object can be instantiated from.
# Attributes of the class are the objects accesible tools (What an object could be)
# Feilds: Variables that belong ot an object or a class
# Type 1: It belongs to the instance of the class 
# Type 2: it belongs to the class itself
# methods are functions that the object can call
# remember to Capitilize classname, unlike variables
# after defining the class, add its attributes, then assighn a variable with an instantion of the class to interact with it
# use paranthesis when calling the class name
'''
Example
class Person:
    # block code
# end of the person class
student1 = Person() # student1 is now a person object

ENCAPSULATION

# Encapsulation is restricting the access to the classes/objects certain attributes and methods. We use (__) to do this.

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, last, num):
        self.name = name
        self.last = last
        
        self.__StudentNumber = num
        # self.__StudentNumber is an ecapsulated attribute
    def __getStudentNUmber(self):
        # __getStudentNUmber is an encapsulated method
        return self.__StudentNumber

s1 = Student('mr', 'park', 10)

print(s1.name)

s1.name = "ms"

print(s1.name)
# will now print 'ms' as we mutated the variable.

print(s1.__getStudentNUmber()) # Causes an error because the method '__getstudentNumber' has encapsulation. if it did not have __, then the number would print.

print(s1.__StudentNUmber) # causes error because the attribute is private.

# HOW TO ACCESS ENCAPSULATED ATTRIBUTES
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
    def set_name(self, newname):
        self.__name = newname
    def getname(self):
        print(self.__name)

# The getter and setter method will allow us to access encapuslated attributes.
    

p1 = Person('jimmy')
p1.set_name('candy')
p1.getname()









OVERRIDING

# Overloading: is two methods in one class that have the same method name, but differernt parameters.

# Overriding: two methods with the same method name and parameter.abs

'''
-One method is in the parent class (lesson 3)
-One method is in the child class (lesson 3)
-Overriding allows the child class to provide specific implementation for a method that exists in the parent class
-You can also override built-in magic-methods. OR Base-functions
NOTE: There are NO OVERLOADING IN Python 3.
'''

class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print('this animal is eating')

# rabbit inehrates from the Animal class, therefore it is the child class

# because of inehatince the rabbit class has access to the .eat() method in the animal class.
class Rabbit(Animal):
    def eat(self):
        print('the rabbit is eating carrots')
        # this is ovverriding the .eat() method in the parent class and then providing a more specific implementation.

r = Rabbit()
r.eat()
# will print out the .eat() method in the Rabbit class which is the more specific implementation of the method.








BASE OVERRIDES

# Base Overrides

# two different classes can have the same attributes and methods.

# a child class and parent class have an overrided method, where the child class utilizes the parent method differntly (Example in Overriding.py)

# EXAMPLE

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.__name = name
    def __str__(self):
        return f'woof I am {self.__name}'
    # dont have to call the __str__ function. It is a base override in python that makes our object readable.
d = Dog('jimmy')
print(d)

# __repr__(object) returns a strong containing a printable represntation of an object.

# __str__() allows us to convert out object to a string.

# __repr__() allows us to present a printable version of our object.









POLYMORPHISM

# Polymorphism: is a method that can be used across different classes and objects that is dependent on the parameters.

# - Different Classes (non-inherited) can have the same named methods (Simple) â†’ Polymorphism
# - Within a set of inherited classes have the same methods

# EXAMPLE

class Bear:
    def sound(self):
        print('groar')
class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        print('woof woof')
def makesound(animalType):
    animalType.sound()

b = Bear()
d = Dog()
makesound(b)
makesound(d)
# in conclusion we gave two differnt classes same methods, hence polymorphism.

# Overriding is also an example of Polymorphism

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.__name = name
        self.__age = age
    def show(self):
        return self.__name
    def show(self, num):
        return f'{self.__name}, {self.__age}'

# the show method is presented twice in one class and has different parameters hence overloading.
  
  
  
  





INHERITANCE

# Inheritance is when an object or class is based another class; where its features are from a parent class

'''
Types:

- Single Inheritance: a subclass inheriting the features of a single superclass/parent class.
- Multiple inheritnace: a subclass inheriting the features of a multiple parent class
- Multilevel inheritnace: a subclass inheriting from another subclass A - B - C.
'''

# What can we do with inheritance: a child will recieve all attributes and methods of the parent.

# the child can than enhance itself with new attributes and methods. The child can also OVERRIDE attributes and methods for their own liking.

# if a child class inherits the parent class: the child does not need a new __init__() unless it requires new attributes.

# the child does not need to reinstate the parents methods unless you override them.

#EXAMPLE
class Parent:
    def __init__(self, name):
         self.__name = name
    def getname(self):
        return self.__name

# Child class
class Child(Parent):
    def __init__(self, name, num):
        Parent.__init__(self, name)
        self.__num = num

        # using the method 'self.getname()' from the parent class.
p = Parent('jill')
c = Child('hello' ,19)
print(c.getChildname())  
print(p.getname())
print(c.getname())

# What is super(): is a built in method for classes to refer to their parent class.

OOP VIDEO NOTES

# Object Orientated Programming in Python

# WHAT IS AN OBJECT


def hello():
    print('hello')

x = 1 

# Type prints out the type of the data the argument is (Example '1' is a int).

print(type(hello))

# When u create something in python u are creating an object which is an instance of a specific class, and that class defines the way an object interacts with other things in our program.

x = 1

y = 'hello'

print(x + y)

# Because the objects are different typeso data they cannot interact with one another. 


# METHODS

string = 'hello'
print(string.upper())

# .upper() is a method acting on object type string stored in variable called string. It converts the string into uppercase letters.

# CREATING A CLASS

class Dog:
    def add_one(self, x):
        return x + 1
    def bark(self):
        print('bark')

# created a class called Dog

# method called bark and called add_one.
d = Dog()
# d is an object of the class 'Dog'
d.bark()
# calling our method 'bark' on our dog object.
print(d.add_one(2))
# This is calling the method 'add_one' on our dog object.



# INIT METHOD

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name

    def get_name(self):

       # 'self' allows us to accesss attributes specific to each cat object.

  

c = Cat('Marel', 13)

c2 = Cat('bill', 18)
print(c2.name)

c.get_name()
# return name of obj c.
c2.get_name()
# returns name of obj c2. (different from c.get_name)


# MODIFYING ATTRIBUTES

class Cat:
